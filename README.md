# StreamElementsDonationGoal

Been looking for a donation goal that can actually track donations not just for session/week/month/alltime so created this simple and highly customizable donation goal widget.

## How to install

 - Open an overlay for edit
 - Add (+ sign) -> Static/Custom -> Custom widget
 - Copy contents of:
   - main.html to HTML
   - style.css to CSS
   - app.js to JS
   - fields.json to FIELDS
  
  
## Done
